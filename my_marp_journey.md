# Hi :wave:
---

## Welcome to this presentation
### This is written in markdown, on **Marp** :hushed:
---

## I will be sharing about my marp journey in this presentation :rocket:

---

### Firstly, let's talk about the **pros** :cookie:
1) This is really cool (it's not everyday you get to write your ppt in VSCode)
2) It is written in Markdown, so I get to practise my markdown skills since I use Obsidian as well
3) I can present this as html lol

---

### Next, let's talk about the **cons** :skull:
1) It can't replace word/slides fully as it does not have many of their functionalities 
2) It is kinda cursed to do a serious ppt; eg a presentation of hundreds of pages
3) plugins are kinda cursed 

---

### All in all, this is niche and suitable for short & casual presentations, but you can really put in some serious work if you want to

## Thanks for dropping by :grin:
