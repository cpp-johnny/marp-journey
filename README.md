# Marp Journey
## Hi! :wave: 
This is a repository of my Marp Journey.

## Why Marp, you may ask
To be frank, I'm not too sure either

I came across it one day, and decided to try it out, and here we are :woozy_face:	

## What does this serve as?
This repo is just the source code for my Marp presentations if you wanna read them :skull:	

## How do I view the Marp Presentation?
Click the environment, there should be a link there

## How and where is this deployed?
It's deployed on google sites because I can't get Vercel to work lol and gsite is the easiest
