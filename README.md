# Marp Journey
## Hi! :wave: 
This is a repository of my Marp Journey.

## Why Marp, you may ask
To be frank, I'm not too sure either

I [came across it](https://youtu.be/EzQ-p41wNEE) one day, and decided to try it out, and here we are :woozy_face:	

## What does this serve as?
This repo is just the source code for my Marp presentations if you wanna read them :skull:	

## How do I view the Marp Presentation?
Click the environment, there should be a link there

## How and where is this deployed?
It's deployed on google sites because I can't get Vercel to work lol and gsite is the easiest

## How do you create the same thing like this?
You can download the Marp extension on VS Code, and find tutorials for Marp. 

Make sure you have a browser installed on your codinf environment!! If you're on PLD like me :skull: remember to enable dev mode and run `$ sudo apt install chromium` or whatever browser you want
